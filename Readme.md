# Privacy Policy
Nice Rock Studios is committed to providing quality services to you and this policy outlines our ongoing obligations to you in respect of how we manage your Personal Information.
We have adopted the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (the Privacy Act). The NPPs govern the way in which we collect, use, disclose, store, secure and dispose of your Personal Information.
A copy of the Australian Privacy Principles may be obtained from the website of The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner at www.aoic.gov.au

## What is Personal Information and what do we collect?
Personal Information is information or an opinion that identifies an individual. Examples of Personal Information we collect include: names, addresses, email addresses, phone and facsimile numbers.
The **only personal information collected is your email address** to use as a login and potentially for any communication about the service, for example, if your subscription has expired or to reset your password. This email address will never be shared with a third party. 

## What Other Information Does the App Collect?
The only other data the app collects is the recipes and recipe plans that are entered into the app exactly as entered by you the user.

## Sensitive Information
Sensitive information is defined in the Privacy Act to include information or opinion about such things as an individual's racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, membership of a political association, religious or philosophical beliefs, membership of a trade union or other professional body, criminal record or health information.
Sensitive information will be used by us only:
* For the primary purpose for which it was obtained
* For a secondary purpose that is directly related to the primary purpose
* With your consent; or where required or authorised by law.

**This app does not collect any sensitive information.**

## Third Parties
**We will never share your data with any third parties.**

## Disclosure of Personal Information
Your Personal Information may be disclosed in a number of circumstances including the following:
* Where required or authorised by law.
Given the nature of the app I believe it to be incredibly unlikely to ever be requested by law to disclose your email address or recipes.

## Security of Personal Information
Your Personal Information is stored in a manner that reasonably protects it from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.
When your Personal Information is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was obtained, we will take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify your Personal Information. 

## Access to your Data
You may access the data we hold about you and to update and/or correct it, subject to certain exceptions. If you wish to access your Personal Information, please contact us in writing.
Nice Rock Studios will not charge any fee for your access request, but may charge an administrative fee for providing a copy of your Personal Information.
In order to protect your Personal Information we may require identification from you before releasing the requested information.

## Policy Updates
This Policy may change from time to time and is available on our website.
